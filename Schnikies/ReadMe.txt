Schnikies
---------
Schnikies is a great event reminding program. I wrote it out of my own need to remember Birthdays. Before you can use Schnikies, you will need to install Mircosoft's Agent software on your computer. Please follow the following steps to configure your computer.

1. Install Microsoft's Agent
   http://activex.microsoft.com/activex/controls/agent2/MSagent.exe

2. Install Microsoft's Peedy Agent
   http://agent.microsoft.com/agent2/chars/peedy.exe

3. Install Microsoft's Text-to-Speech Engine
   http://activex.microsoft.com/activex/controls/agent2/tv_enua.exe

4. Install the following DLLs, located in the DLL directory, by copying them
   to your System32 folder and registering them:
   scrrun.dll 
   Stkit432.dll


Now you are set to go. After compiling and running Schnikies, if you select "Settings->Check on Startup" from the menu, a shortcut will be created so that Schnikies will check your events everytime your computer boots up. Enjoy the program.
